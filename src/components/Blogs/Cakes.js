       <p>Cake is a form of sweet food made from flour, sugar, and other ingredients, that is usually baked. In their oldest 
           forms, cakes were modifications of bread, but cakes now cover a wide range of preparations that can be simple or 
           elaborate, and that share features with other desserts such as pastries, meringues, custards, and pies. The 
           most commonly used cake ingredients include flour, sugar, eggs, butter or oil or margarine, a liquid, and 
           leavening agents, such as baking soda or baking powder. Common additional ingredients and flavourings include 
           dried, candied, or fresh fruit, nuts, cocoa, and extracts such as vanilla, with numerous substitutions for the 
           primary ingredients. Cakes can also be filled with fruit preserves, nuts or dessert sauces (like pastry cream), 
           iced with buttercream or other icings, and decorated with marzipan, piped borders, or candied fruit.
           Cake is often served as a celebratory dish on ceremonial occasions, such as weddings, anniversaries, and 
           birthdays. There are countless cake recipes; some are bread-like, some are rich and elaborate, and many are 
           centuries old. Cake making is no longer a complicated procedure; while at one time considerable labor went 
           into cake making (particularly the whisking of egg foams), baking equipment and directions have been simplified
           so that even the most amateur of cooks may bake a cake.</p>

            <p>During the Great Depression, there was a surplus of molasses and the need to provide easily made food to 
                millions of economically depressed people in the United States.[8] One company patented a cake-bread mix 
                to deal with this economic situation, and thereby established the first line of cake in a box. In so doing, 
                cake, as it is known today, became a mass-produced good rather than a home- or bakery-made specialty. Later, 
                during the post-war boom, other American companies (notably General Mills) developed this idea further, 
                marketing cake mix on the principle of convenience, especially to housewives. When sales dropped heavily in 
                the 1950s, marketers discovered that baking cakes, once a task at which housewives could exercise skill and 
                creativity, had become dispiriting. This was a period in American ideological history when women, retired from
                the war-time labor force, were confined to the domestic sphere, while still exposed to the blossoming 
                consumerism in the US.[9] This inspired psychologist Ernest Dichter to find a solution to the cake mix problem 
                in the frosting.[10] Since making the cake was so simple, housewives and other in-home cake makers could expend 
                their creative energy on cake decorating inspired by, among other things, photographs in magazines of elaborately 
                decorated cakes. Ever since cake in a box has become a staple of supermarkets and is complemented with frosting in 
                a can.</p>

               <p>Cakes may be classified according to the occasion for which they are intended. For example, wedding 
                   cakes, birthday cakes, cakes for first communion, Christmas cakes, Halloween cakes, and Passover plava 
                   (a type of sponge cake sometimes made with matzo meal) are all identified primarily according to the 
                   celebration they are intended to accompany. The cutting of a wedding cake constitutes a social ceremony 
                   in some cultures. The Ancient Roman marriage ritual of confarreatio originated in the sharing of a cake. 
                   Particular types of cake may be associated with particular festivals, such as stollen or chocolate log 
                   (at Christmas), babka and simnel cake (at Easter), or mooncake. There has been a long tradition of 
                   decorating an iced cake at Christmas time; other cakes associated with Christmas include chocolate log 
                   and mince pies. A Lancashire Courting Cake is a fruit-filled cake baked by a fiancée for her betrothed. 
                   The cake has been described as "somewhere between a firm sponge – with a greater proportion of flour to 
                   fat and eggs than a Victoria sponge cake – and a shortbread base and was proof of the bride-to-be's baking 
                   skills". Traditionally it is a two-layer cake filled and topped with strawberries or raspberries and whipped 
                   cream. </p>
