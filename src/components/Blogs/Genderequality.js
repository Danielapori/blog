       <p>Gender inequality is the idea that men and women are not equal and that gender affects an individual's living 
           experience. These differences arise from distinctions in biology, psychology, and cultural norms. Some of 
           these types of distinctions are empirically grounded while others appear to be socially constructed. Gender 
           inequality also affects non-binary people. Studies show the different lived experiences of genders across many
           domains including education, life expectancy, personality, interests, family life, careers, and political 
           affiliations. Gender inequality is experienced differently across different cultures</p>

            <p>Natural differences exist between the sexes based on biological and anatomic factors, mostly differing 
                reproductive roles. Biological differences include chromosomes and hormonal differences.[1] There is a 
                natural difference also in the relative physical strengths (on average) of the sexes, both in the lower 
                body and more pronouncedly in the upper-body, though this does not mean that any given man is stronger 
                than any given woman.[2][3] Men, on average, are taller, which provides both advantages and disadvantages.
                Women, on average, live significantly longer than men,[5] though it is not clear to what extent this is a 
                biological difference - see Life expectancy. Men have larger lung volumes and more circulating blood cells 
                and clotting factors, while women have more circulating white blood cells and produce antibodies faster. 
                Differences such as these are hypothesized to be an adaption allowing for sexual specialization.</p>

            <p>Prenatal hormone exposure influences extent one exhibits traditional masculine or feminine behavior. 
                Negligible differences between males and females exist in general intelligence. Men are significantly 
                more likely to take risks than women. Men are also more likely than women to be aggressive, a trait 
                influenced by prenatal and possibly current androgen exposure. It has been theorized that these 
                differences combined with physical differences are an adaption representing sexual division of labor. 
                A second theory proposes sex differences in intergroup aggression represent adaptions in male aggression to 
                allow for territory, resource and mate acquisition. Females are (on average) more empathetic than males, 
                though this does not mean that any given woman is more empathetic than any given man. Men and women have 
                better visuospatial and verbal memory, respectively. These changes are influenced by the male sex hormone 
                testosterone, which increases visuospatial memory in both genders when administered.</p>

               <p>From birth males and females are raised differently and experienced different environments throughout 
                   their lives. In the eyes of society, gender has a huge role to play in many major milestones or 
                   characteristics in life; like personality. Males and females are led on different paths due to the 
                   influences of gender role expectations and gender role stereotypes before they are able to choose their 
                   own. The colour blue is most commonly associated with boys and they get toys like monster trucks or more 
                   sport related things to play with from the time that they are babies. Girls are more commonly introduced 
                   to the colour pink, dolls, dresses, and playing house where they are taking care of the dolls as if they 
                   were children. The norm of blue is for boys and pink is for girls is cultural and has not always 
                   historically been around. These paths set by parents or other adult figures in the child's life set them 
                   on certain paths.This leads to a difference in personality, career paths, or relationships. 
                   Throughout life, males and females are seen as two very different species who have very different 
                   personalities and should stay on separate paths.</p>
